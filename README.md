# Web Scraper
1. In a git branch, write a script that will scrape the content of three websites that you define and saves them on the local disk as .html pages. 
2. Branch Name: scraper

# API
1. In a second branch, convert your script into a rest API that can be passed a url and return the homepage content as a string
2. Branch Name: api

# UI
1. In a third branch, build an interface with a text box that accepts one or more urls, and a button to submit the form. Use your api from step 2 to display the content of each url as a raw html string in a results area of the interface. I should be able to tell which url corresponds with which html string.
